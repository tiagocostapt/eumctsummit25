			<h3>UA92 in Manchester</h3>		
			<div>University Academy 92 (UA92), situated in the bustling area of Old Trafford, Manchester, is not 
				only a pioneering higher education institution but also a prime conference venue. Nestled in the 
				iconic building that once housed Kellogg’s, UA92 boasts state-of-the-art facilities including a 
				spacious events suite, a 146-seater auditorium, and versatile break-out rooms, tailored for a 
				diverse array of events and conferences. The campus is a stone’s throw away from the Old 
				Trafford tram station, ensuring seamless connectivity to Manchester’s extensive transport 
				network.</div>
			<div>UA92's journey began in September 2017, born from a partnership between Lancaster 
				University and the Class of '92, a group of esteemed Manchester United footballers, with a 
				vision to offer education that transcends traditional academic boundaries. The institution 
				emphasizes personal growth and employability, preparing students for real-world challenges.
				A significant aspect of UA92's ethos is its collaboration with industry leaders to enrich the 
				educational experience. Microsoft, as a key partner, plays a vital role in integrating technology 
				and innovation into both the curriculum and the conference facilities. This partnership ensures 
				that UA92 remains at the forefront of digital advancements, providing cutting-edge resources for 
				students and conference attendees alike. The involvement of Microsoft underlines UA92’s 
				commitment to delivering a modern, tech-driven environment conducive to learning, 
				professional development, and event success.</div>
			<div>Manchester is a dynamic city in the heart of the United Kingdom known for its rich industrial 
				heritage and vibrant cultural scene. As the birthplace of the industrial revolution, Manchester 
				has transformed into a hub of creativity, innovation, and sports. The city boasts an impressive 
				array of museums, galleries, and theatres, alongside a thriving music and nightlife. Visitors can 
				explore the historic architecture, indulge in diverse culinary delights, and experience the 
				legendary friendliness of Mancunians. With excellent transport links and a packed calendar of 
				events, Manchester is a city that invites exploration and promises memorable experiences for 
				all who visit.</div>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 logo is based on the bee icon, which is a proud emblem of 
				Manchester, symbolizing the city’s industrious past and its citizens’ hard work ethic. Adopted 
				during the Industrial Revolution, the worker bee represents Manchester’s role as a hive of 
				activity and enterprise. It’s featured on the city’s coat of arms and is scattered throughout 
				Manchester, from buildings to street art, signifying the community’s resilience and unity. The 
				bee has gained even more significance following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, 
				embodying the city’s spirit of solidarity and defiance in the face of adversity.</div>
