			<h3>Policies</h3>		
			<div>Our policies are based on those of our successful events organising partner, Scottish Summit. 
				We acknowledge their outstanding work in designing and implementing inclusive events with 
				robust policies and thank them for their permission to base our policies on theirs. Please refer 
				to <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com/policies/" target="_blank">https://www.scottishsummit.com/policies/</a> for the original policies. If you are an event 
				organiser and also wish to base your policies on these please obtain permission from Scottish 
				Summit via <a href="mailto:contact@scottishsummit.com" target="_blank">contact@scottishsummit.com</a></div>

			<h3>Inclusion by Design</h3>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 is proud to be inclusive by design. Whilst inclusion isn’t something 
				that can ever be 'completed' as such, we are proud to build it into our DNA and work towards 
				ensuring everyone has a safe and positive experience.</div>
			<div>As per our Code of Conduct, we do not tolerate racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, 
				biphobia, misogyny, ableism or other discriminatory jokes, language or beliefs. This includes but 
				is not limited to the conference event itself, pre and post conference organised events, the 
				conference feedback forms and social media discussion around the event. Please note that if 
				you find this onerous or otherwise difficult to adhere to, European MCT Summit 2025 is not the 
				event for you.</div>
			<div>Information about the venue and it's accessibility can be found at <a href="https://www.accessable.co.uk/university-academy-92-ua92/access-guides/university-academy-92-ua92" target="_blank">University Academy 92 (UA92) 
				| AccessAble</a></div>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 would like to remind all attendees that not all disabilities are 
				visible, and that 'bathroom policing' in any form is not acceptable.</div>
			<div>Speakers are requested to ensure that each session is auto-captioned, and to make their 
				presentations/session handouts available for download afterwards. The venue will be very busy 
				on the day, however, there are quiet areas available in the venue if you feel you need a quieter 
				place.</div>
			<div>We understand that some community events, particularly in tech, have a bad name when it 
				comes to inclusivity and diversity, however, we are very proud to be following the lead of our 
				organisation partner, Scottish Summit, in working to change this.</div>
			<div>If you feel your requirements may not be catered for, if you have any concerns or would just like 
				to discuss this with us, please get in touch.</div>

			<h3>Selection</h3>
			<h4>Volunteer Selection</h4>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 depends on volunteers to be able to bring you our events. We have 
				an open volunteer policy that allows anyone to volunteer. During the volunteer recruitment 
				process, the online form is shared via the website and social media. Every person who applies 
				will be accepted into the team</div>
			<div>During the process we gather information on Name, Preferred Jobs and Email Address, thus 
				giving us volunteers from all backgrounds.</div>

			</br>
			<h4>Speaker Selection</h4>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 has created a diverse pool of volunteers who will review all 
				sessions. The selection process is made up of 3 rounds:</div>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Round 1:</b> Blind review of sessions by volunteers. Volunteers are to review, then score
					and rank sessions based on session title & description only. The top 40 sessions will 
					procced to the next round.</li>
				<li><b>Round 2:</b> Review of sessions by volunteers. Volunteers are to review top 40 sessions, 
					with full access to all information submitted by speakers. Top 30 sessions will proceed 
					to the next round.</li>
				<li><b>Round 3:</b> The event organisers will build the agenda. The agenda will consist of 20 
					sessions and selection will be made based on ranking by volunteers. This process will 
					select the top 20 sessions, however in the event that one of those sessions or the 
					speaker does not fit the stated requirements of the event then the next highest scoring 
					session will be selected. </li>
			</ul>
			<div>The organiser’s session selection is final and decision making discussions will not be made 
				public. Where feedback has been provided by volunteers or organisers for speakers this will be 
				shared with you.</div>

			<h3>Suitcasing</h3>
			<h4>Suitcasing and Outboarding Policy</h4>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 depends on our exhibitors and sponsors for successful events. As 
				such, we are mandating increased measures to protect our exhibitors/sponsors from 
				“suitcasing/outboarding” at our conferences and meetings.</div>
			
			</br>
			<h4>Statement of Intent</h4>
			<div>In order to protect our valued exhibitors/sponsors and the investment they make in the event, 
				thereby supporting the European MCT Summit 2025 mission, our rules strictly prohibit 
				solicitation, “suitcasing” or “outboarding” by attendees who transact or promote business at 
				our conferences and meetings and do NOT have exhibit booths or sponsor investment.</div>
			<div>By suitcasing or outboarding the show, an attendee gains an unfair competitive advantage over 
				exhibitors/ sponsors that have invested money and other resources to participate in the events.</div>

			</br>
			<h4>What is Suitcasing and Outboarding?</h4>
			<div>“Suitcasing” and “Outboarding” are unethical parasitic business practices in which nonexhibitors and non-sponsors attempt to gain access to conference attendees. This is either by 
				walking the show promoting/selling products or hosting off-site events during the period of time 
				European MCT Summit 2025is in a given area.</div>
			<div>“Suitcasing” refers to those non-participating companies or persons who go to conferences as 
				an attendee but “work the aisles” form their suitcase and solicit business in the aisles, session 
				rooms, or even the lobby area. Examples of this include the distribution of samples, flyers, and 
				other materials to attendees.</div>
			<div>“Outboarding” refers to non-participating companies that set up meetings, parties and demos 
				at offsite locations such as hotel hospitality suites or restaurants, and encourage show 
				attendees to leave the conference and show and spend time with them without the prior 
				approval of European MCT Summit 2025.</div>


			</br>
			<h4>Examples may include but are not limited to:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A non-exhibitor sets up a hospitality room outside the show and/or invites attendees to 
					leave the show and visit their suite.</li>
				<li>A non-exhibitor sends out alerts to potential customers that while they will not be 
					participating this year they will have personnel walking the show and/or will be offering 
					demos or show specials.</li>
				<li>A non-exhibitor branding themselves at the event to give the impression that they are an 
					exhibitor or sponsor.</li>
				<li>A non-exhibitor puts together a webpage with the conference logo and solicits meetings 
					with attendees.</li>
				<li>A non-exhibitor piggybacks on the activities of a third party such as a vendor or partner 
					who is exhibiting.
					</li>
			</ul>

			</br>
			<h4>What are the Consequences of Suitcasing or Outboarding?</h4>
			<div>Please note that any attendee at a European MCT Summit 2025 conference or meeting, who is 
				observed to be soliciting business in the aisles or other public spaces, or uninvited attendees in 
				another company's booth, will be asked to leave immediately.</div>
			<div>Likewise, known commercial activity conducted from a hotel guest room or hospitality suite, a 
				restaurant or any other public place in proximity to European MCT Summit 2025 conferences by 
				non-participating companies, will be shut down if utilizing properties with which European MCT 
				Summit 2025 has an agreement. Companies that violate this policy will be given a warning upon 
				European MCT Summit 2025 management finding out about said outside event, and potentially 
				run the risk of being banned from participating in future European MCT Summit 2025 events.</div>

					Summit 2025, such as event updates, promotions, and offerings that could enrich the

					any other purposes unless explicit consent is obtained from the attendee.</li>
				<li><b>Data Minimization:</b> Only necessary data, such as name, email address, company 
					name, and job title, will be shared. We do not share sensitive personal data.</li>
				<li><b>Security:</b> All sponsors are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of the

					any time. To opt-out, please send an email to <a href="mailto:event@mctrl.co.uk">event@mctrl.co.uk</a> stating your request. 
					The European MCT Summit 2025 team will process your request promptly.</li>
				<li><b>Retention:</b> Sponsors are required to delete or anonymize the shared data after a 
					specified period or upon conclusion of the event, unless an attendee has expressly 
					consented to the continued use of their data.</li>
			</ul>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 reserves the right to revise this Data Sharing Policy from time to 
				time. All changes will be communicated to attendees in a timely manner.</div>
			<div>We encourage attendees to carefully review this policy and reach out to us at

				dedicated to preserving it by treating your data with the utmost respect and care.</div>
