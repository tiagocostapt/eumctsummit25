			<h3>Policies</h3>		
			<div>Our policies are based on those of our successful events organising partner, Scottish Summit. 
				We acknowledge their outstanding work in designing and implementing inclusive events with 
				robust policies and thank them for their permission to base our policies on theirs. Please refer 
				to <a href="https://www.scottishsummit.com/policies/" target="_blank">https://www.scottishsummit.com/policies/</a> for the original policies. If you are an event 
				organiser and also wish to base your policies on these please obtain permission from Scottish 
				Summit via <a href="mailto:contact@scottishsummit.com" target="_blank">contact@scottishsummit.com</a></div>

			<h3>Inclusion by Design</h3>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 is proud to be inclusive by design. Whilst inclusion isn’t something 
				that can ever be 'completed' as such, we are proud to build it into our DNA and work towards 
				ensuring everyone has a safe and positive experience.</div>
			<div>As per our Code of Conduct, we do not tolerate racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, 
				biphobia, misogyny, ableism or other discriminatory jokes, language or beliefs. This includes but 
				is not limited to the conference event itself, pre and post conference organised events, the 
				conference feedback forms and social media discussion around the event. Please note that if 
				you find this onerous or otherwise difficult to adhere to, European MCT Summit 2025 is not the 
				event for you.</div>
			<div>Information about the venue and it's accessibility can be found at <a href="https://www.accessable.co.uk/university-academy-92-ua92/access-guides/university-academy-92-ua92" target="_blank">University Academy 92 (UA92) 
				| AccessAble</a></div>
			<div>European MCT Summit 2025 would like to remind all attendees that not all disabilities are 
				visible, and that 'bathroom policing' in any form is not acceptable.</div>
			<div>Speakers are requested to ensure that each session is auto-captioned, and to make their 
				presentations/session handouts available for download afterwards. The venue will be very busy 
				on the day, however, there are quiet areas available in the venue if you feel you need a quieter 
				place.</div>
			<div>We understand that some community events, particularly in tech, have a bad name when it 
				comes to inclusivity and diversity, however, we are very proud to be following the lead of our 
				organisation partner, Scottish Summit, in working to change this.</div>
			<div>If you feel your requirements may not be catered for, if you have any concerns or would just like 
				to discuss this with us, please get in touch.</div>
